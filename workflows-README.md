# GitHub Actions workflows

This repository has two GitHub Actions workflows:

1. `test.yml` runs standards, Rust tests, the JavaScript build, and the example app build on
   pushes to `main` and on pull requests.
2. `release.yml` runs only when a `v*` tag is pushed. The tag must be an annotated tag with a
   GitHub-verified signature.

## Release workflow behavior

When a signed release tag is pushed, `release.yml` does this:

1. Verifies the tag is annotated and GitHub marks its signature as verified.
2. Confirms the tag version matches:
   * `package.json`
   * `Cargo.toml`
   * `crates/device-ai/Cargo.toml`
   * the root crate's `device-ai` dependency version
3. Re-runs the repository release gates:
   * `npm run standards`
   * `cargo test --all-targets --all-features`
   * `npm run build`
   * the example app build
   * `cargo package --locked` for `device-ai`
   * `cargo package --list` for the plugin crate, because the plugin depends on `device-ai`
     being present on crates.io before a full publish verification can succeed
4. Publishes `device-ai` to crates.io.
5. Publishes `tauri-plugin-device-ai-apis` to crates.io, retrying while the `device-ai`
   release propagates through the crates.io index.
6. Publishes `@yurvon-screamo/tauri-plugin-device-ai-apis` to npm with provenance.
7. Creates a GitHub release for the tag with generated release notes.

## Required repository configuration

Before the first release, complete the one-time setup in `.github/TRUSTED_PUBLISHING_SETUP.md`.

The workflow expects:

1. npm Trusted Publishing for `@yurvon-screamo/tauri-plugin-device-ai-apis`
2. a repository secret named `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
3. maintainers who create release tags to have a GPG key configured locally and uploaded to
   GitHub so tag signatures verify
